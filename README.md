# Goal-Oriented Dialogue System for Restaurant Booking

## Project Overview
This project implements a sophisticated goal-oriented dialogue system (conversational AI) for restaurant booking using the DeepPavlov framework. The chatbot assists users in finding restaurants based on their food preferences and price range, providing detailed information about available options.

## Key Features
- **Restaurant Recommendation**: Suggests restaurants based on cuisine type and price preferences
- **Information Retrieval**: Provides details about restaurants including location, ratings, and hours
- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains conversation context to provide relevant responses
- **Goal-Oriented Dialogue**: Guides users through the booking process step by step

## Technical Implementation

### Framework
The system is built on DeepPavlov, an open-source conversational AI library built on TensorFlow and Keras. DeepPavlov provides a robust framework for developing complex conversational systems with natural language understanding capabilities.

### Dataset
The DSTC-2 (Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 2) dataset was used to train the model. This dataset contains restaurant booking dialogues that help the system learn appropriate responses in various conversation scenarios.

### Architecture
The dialogue system consists of several key components:
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Interprets user inputs and extracts intents and entities
- **Dialogue State Tracking**: Maintains the current state of the conversation
- **Policy Management**: Determines the next action based on the current state
- **Natural Language Generation**: Formulates appropriate responses to the user

## Dialogue Flow
1. **Information Collection**: The system gathers user preferences (cuisine type, price range, location)
2. **Database Query**: Searches for restaurants matching the specified criteria
3. **Result Presentation**: Presents matching restaurants with relevant details
4. **Clarification**: Asks follow-up questions if user preferences are ambiguous
5. **Confirmation**: Confirms booking details before finalizing

## Technical Challenges
- Handling ambiguous user inputs
- Maintaining context across multiple turns of conversation
- Balancing between directed dialogue flow and natural conversation
- Optimizing response generation for diverse user queries

## Applications
- Restaurant and hospitality industry customer service
- Automated booking systems
- Customer preference analysis
- Conversational interface research

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with actual restaurant booking systems
- Multi-modal interactions (voice, images)
- Personalization based on user history
- Expanded domain knowledge beyond restaurants

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- DeepPavlov framework
- Natural Language Processing techniques
- Dialogue State Tracking algorithms
